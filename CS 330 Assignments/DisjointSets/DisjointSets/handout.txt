Implement Kruskal algorithm using disjoint sets.

Roadmap: 
1) implement Kruskal algorithm with colors (file kruskal.h, function kruskal_vector)

2) implement disjoint sets (files disjoint_sets.h and disjoint_sets.cpp)
use driver_disjoint_sets.cpp (Makefile target gcc0_ds and msc0_ds). 
Master output is in ds-out0,...,ds-out10

3) convert Kruskal algorithm (file kruskal.h, function kruskal_disjoint_subsets) from using
colors to using disjoint sets

Targets:
disjoint sets: gcc0_ds. msc0_ds. Executables are named same way. To test
gcc0_ds.exe test > student_test, where test is a number 0,....,10
compare student_test to master output out-ds...

kruskal: gcc0, msc0. Executables are named same way. There are 3 tests (0,1,2). 
Master output is in out0,out1,out2
Times:
test0 - immediate
test1 - 200ms
test2 - 20ms  (disjoint subsets are 10 times faster then vector of colors)

Submit:
kruskal.h (no kruskal.cpp, so implementation goes into the header)
disjoint_sets.cpp
